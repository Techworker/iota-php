# IOTA-PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Techworker/iota-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Techworker/iota-php)

This project is an unofficial IOTA client library implementation in PHP.

To getting started with IOTA follow this link https://learn.iota.org/

**Please be aware that this library is in an early development state and the API 
of the library as well as the IOTA protocol is subject to change, so you might 
end up with errors on updates for now. Call it alpha, it is NOT ready to use in 
production.**

However, I encourage you to try it out and find bugs or suggest improvements. 
Apart from that, happy feeless money transferring and welcome to the future!
